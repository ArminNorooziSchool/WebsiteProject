    <h3>How do the games work?</h3>
    <p>
      Currently there are 8 main-line generations of Pokemon, starting with Red
      and Blue, and with Scarlet and Violet being the most recent released in
      2022. The games follow a format where you are given a starter, and go
      around the main story catching more pokemon, beating trainers, gyms and
      evil teams. Eventually challenging the Elite 4 and Champion, in which you
      will defeat and become the new champion of the region. Every new region
      adds more new Pokemon, a new story, and new mechanics.

    <h3>How does combat work?</h3>
    <p>
      In the Pokemon games every pokemon has up to 2 typings, these typings
      dictate what moves are super effective on them, and what moves are
      ineffective. Every pokemon has 4 moves, each also having a typing, power
      level, accuracy, and a counter of how many times it may be used. When a
      move is used the amount of damage done is based on the moves power, and
      the type of pokemon it is being used on, if you use a fire move against a
      Gyrados it will be not very effective and do half the damage because of
      Gyrados being a water and flying type, but if an electric type move is
      used on a Gyrados it is super effective and will do double the damage.

    <h3>What are the Pokemon Typings?</h3>
    <p>
      There are multiple types like water, fire, grass, and electric and they
      all have different effects on one another. The most important type trio is
      that Water beats Fire, Fire beats Grass, and Grass beats Water.

      The mascot has been Pikachu due to the anime. Within the anime, the main
      character is Ash Ketchum, whos primary pokemon and best friend is a
      Pikachu. Pikachu is a electric pokemon and resembles a mouse. Pikachu is
      also a very good choice for a mascot as it is a very cute, friendly, and
      loveable pokemon, allowing both younger and older audiences to love
      Pikachu.
